 <!-- 
	Multiple resources for a cache host process can be monitored for a specified duration by enabling following feature.
	Resources will be monitored for specified duration with respect to their minimum and maximum threshold.
	If monitored value is higher than or equal to maximum threshold or it is lower than or equal to minimum threshold, an event will appear in cache logs and event viewer.
	Event in both cache logs and event viewer will appear after a specific Interval. Logging interval for both logs is provided in minute. 
	For event viewer log its 60 minutes (1 hr) and for cache logs its 10 minute. 
	
	Duration is the sample interval for which a resource will be monitored and its value will be compared to thresholds.  
	This interval is in seconds. Its minimum value is 5 second and maximum value is 15 seconds. 
	
	This xml contains default values of resources. 
	
	By default, this feature is disabled.
